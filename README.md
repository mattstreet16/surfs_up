# Surfs_up

## Using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, and Flask to analyze weather data.


### Overview
After a trip to Hawaii, I discovered my love of surfing and ice cream, and I want to combine my two favorite things and start an ice cream surf shop business on the beach. Running the store will allow me to live out my dream of living in Hawaii and running a business. I will need some investors to start my business and after developing a solid business plan and meeting with investors, W. Avy a famous investor who shares a passion for surfing. He loved the business idea but informed me that he had previously invested in a surf shop that eventually went out of business because of bad weather conditions. W. Avy asked me to run some weather analytics for the shop's location before he was willing to invest. 

### Results 
After running my weather analysis, I discovered a few things:

- June and December have similar weather patterns
- The highs and lows of the summer and winter months are nearly the same
- The two months being so similar show calm weather patterns throughout the year

June Stats: ![june](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99688417/166111832-65904680-1723-44ee-a347-8939956670ba.png) 
December Stats: ![December](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99688417/166111843-7e488f2f-1cde-48f2-9da2-17a9fd0b3853.png)

### Summary
After completing the weather analysis, I can conclude that the location of my surf shop has ideal weather conditions for enjoying both surfing and ice cream. In addition to my analysis, a query that returns the percentage of precipitation, and another query that shows the rainiest times of the year would finalize the weather analysis for W. Avy., The weather data I generate would be more than enough information to ease W. Avy's nerves and allow him to fully invest in the future of SurfnShake.
